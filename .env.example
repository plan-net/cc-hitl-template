# Claude Agent SDK Authentication
# Get your API key from: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys
# Copy this file to .env and add your actual API key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...your-key-here...

# IMPORTANT: After setting this value, you must ALSO copy it to:
# data/config/claude_hitl_template.yaml (runtime_env.env_vars.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
#
# Both files need the SAME literal key value (the actual sk-ant-... string).
# The yaml file does NOT support variable substitution like ${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}.

# GitHub Container Registry Authentication (for build-and-push.sh)
# Create a Personal Access Token at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
# Token needs 'packages:write' scope to push images to ghcr.io
# Also needs 'read:packages' scope to pull private images
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_...your-token-here...

# GitHub Username (for image registry path)
# Used by build-and-push.sh to construct ghcr.io/<username>/claude-hitl-worker:latest
GITHUB_USERNAME=your-github-username

# Configuration Repository URLs
# These repos contain .claude/ folders that are baked into the container image
# Master config: Template/user-level Claude Code settings (commands, skills, etc.)
# Project config: Project-specific Claude Code configuration
MASTER_CONFIG_REPO=git@github.com:your-org/cc-master-agent-config.git
PROJECT_CONFIG_REPO=git@github.com:your-org/cc-example-agent-config.git

# Container Image Configuration
# Full URI with immutable digest (SHA256) for Ray actors
# Format: ghcr.io/<username>/claude-hitl-worker@sha256:<full-digest>
# This ensures Ray actors use the exact container image version you built
# Get this value from the docker-build skill output after building
# IMPORTANT: Must also be set in data/config/claude_hitl_template.yaml
CONTAINER_IMAGE_URI=ghcr.io/your-github-username/claude-hitl-worker@sha256:...your-digest-here...
